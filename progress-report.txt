From our progress proposal we have completed the random graph generator, the lexer/parser,
mostly done with Prim, and are starting on Kruskal. The code to convert a list of vertices
and edges to GraphViz format is also done. The script from hw8 is used to take the .gv format
and generate the images of the before and after of the graph from running Prim's and Kruskal's
algorithm. Also, all of the code is integrated together, and the only input is the amount of
vertices wanted when generating the initial undirected graph. From there the edges and vertices
generated are written to a file called graph.txt. That file is then parsed and made into a 
UndirectedGraph type which is a list of Vertices and a list of Edges. That initial configuration
is then passed to the Prim and Kruskal algorithm. Currently the Prim function generates the initial
state followed by all of the steps to reach the final Minimum Spanning Tree following Prim's algorithm.
Those states are outputted as text files and gv files which can then be turned into images.

We would like to do a project presentation.
